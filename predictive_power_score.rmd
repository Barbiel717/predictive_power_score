# Introduction

This notebook explores the Predictive Power Score (PPS) filter method created by Florian Wetschoreck and posted on [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/rip-correlation-introducing-the-predictive-power-score-3d90808b9598). The article describes the PPS as a data type agnostic normalised score of predictive power. The example in the article provided was written in python, this notebook implements the PPS in R, via a custom function.

To explore the PPS, the house price prediction [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) from kaggle is used. This dataset is relatively large from a dimensional perspective but relatively small with regards to observations.

This notebook will not focus on the exploratory analysis or feature engineering steps in the model building process, but jump directly to evaluating variable importance using this metric. If you are interested in a full analysis of this dataset, then please follow this link to my kaggle [kernal](https://www.kaggle.com/ar89dsl/house-price-eda-predictive-power-score).

# Exploring the target Variable 'saleprice'

The histogram shows the distribution of the 'saleprice' variable across all house sales. We can see that the majority of houses are around 150k in price, this is confirmed by calculating the median which sits at `r format(median(df_model$saleprice, na.rm = T)/ 1000, big.mark = ",")`k. The data has a long tail to the right, indicating that there are a small number of high priced houses. The skewness of house prices is `r round(skewness(df_model$saleprice, na.rm = T), 2)`, as this is above 1 it indicates that the data is highly positively skewed.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

# Visualise the distribution of house price
df_model %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = saleprice)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=50000), labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(y = "Houses") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of House Prices")

```

Applying a log transformation to the 'saleprice' variable makes the the data more symetrical and reduces the skew to `r round(skewness(log(df_model$saleprice), na.rm = T), 2)`. A skewness value between 0 and 0.5 indicates it is now minimally skewed. This can be visualised below in the historgram, in which the distribution appears to be a closer representation of a normal distribution. The log transformation has been explored here but will be applied in a later section.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

# log transformed distribution
ggplot(df_model, aes(log(saleprice))) +
        geom_blank() +
        geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), fill = "blue") +
        stat_function(fun = dnorm, 
                      args = c(mean = mean(log(df_model$saleprice), na.rm = TRUE), 
                               sd = sd(log(df_model$saleprice), na.rm = TRUE)), 
                      col = "red",
                      size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= seq(10, 14, by=0.5)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(x = "saleprice (log)") +
  ggtitle("Log transformed Distribution of House Prices")
